## Core Principles
- Always prioritize clear architecture and modular design over quick hacks.
- Aim for an MVP first, but design all modules to be replaceable and extensible.
- Prefer simple and explicit code over overly abstract patterns.

## Project Constraints
- No legacy system integration.

## Development Rules
- Explain the design and file structure before writing any code.
- When writing code, provide complete, runnable modules.

## Technology Preferences
- Use a Python-based stack.
- Use a local vector database (Chroma).
- Unless otherwise specified, use Streamlit for the UI.
